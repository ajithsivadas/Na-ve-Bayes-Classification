# Na-ve-Bayes-Classification
Naïve Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary and multiclass classification problems. Naive Bayes is a simple supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the Bayes' theorem with strong independent assumptions between the features to produce results. The algorithm just assumes that each input variable is independent. It really is a naive assumption to make about real-world data. Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems. Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
